The TV, speakers and of course the highlight was the bath tub. We had such a memorable stay that I am looking forward to coming back. The host and his team were very responsive and super nice, special shout out to Arjun. Worth every single penny.'

The home has great wifi and an aircon that also works as a heater (helped us stay warm through the harsh Jaipur winter.)The hosts were fantastic, stocking up the fridge with necessary amenities and also sending us a welcome package with treats!The location of the home was great, close to the city centre and about 15 mins from city palace, hawa mahal and the bapu and johri bazaar. Restaurants and bars are easily accessible from the property too!",
